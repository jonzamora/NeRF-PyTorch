# NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields for Novel View Synthesis

---

Written by Jonathan Zamora

## Notes:

Implementations available in both PyTorch [src](src/) and Tensorflow [notebooks](notebooks/nerf_keras.ipynb)

- PyTorch implementation based off of [NeRF-PyTorch](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch)

- Tensorflow implementation based off of [3D Volumetric Rendering with NeRF](https://keras.io/examples/vision/nerf/)

- This is being tested with a private dataset
